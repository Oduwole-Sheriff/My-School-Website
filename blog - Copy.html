			<h2>Our Certificate And Online Programs For 2023</h2>
			<p>This is a blog about habits and hacks to help students get through school. The blog was started by Kathryn Azevedo, a teacher and private coach.

			She has previously taught in private and public school systems and now, she teaches students how to learn via her blog.

			The School Habits blog covers time management, study skills, test anxiety, self-advocacy, improving grades, homework management, procrastination, focus, note-taking, and more topics.

			Kathryn Azevedo also offers some particular services to her blog readers. This includes Standardized test preparation, Executive function coaching, Study skills coaching, Application essay help, School essay help, and Writing instruction.

			This blog features a shop with several helpful materials that students can purchase. This includes homework planners, daily schedule and task list, weekly work planner, weekly homework planner, etc. These materials are sold for as little as $5. 

			As a School Habits reader, you can sign up for the newsletter and get a free copy of the 25 School Habits and Hacks ebook.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The International Student’s blog is a blog that targets students that intend to or are already studying abroad.

			Particularly, it targets international students in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the Caribbean. International students studying online are not left out.

			This student blog is one of the oldest you’ll find as it was started in 2005. It works as a forum too such that students can sign in to drop comments amongst others. 

			Registered users get to enjoy Free Amazon Prime for students with Deserve Edu Mastercard approval, a $20 Flight Discount Code with StudentUniverse, 5% Eurail Discount, 50% off an ISIC Discount Card, and Free Sim card with an accompanying mobile plan.</p>
				<br>
				<p>One important aspect of a student’s life is money management and that’s what the Save The Student blog covers. 

				The blog covers topics on how students can make money, save money, find jobs while studying, pay bills, get accommodation, and manage finances in general.

			This blog was started in 2007 by Owen Burek who was a University of Manchester student at the time.

			It has recorded significant success since its launch as the blog has been featured in top sites like BBC News, The Guardian, The Times, HuffPost, and Independent.

			One thing that keeps this blog going is that they accept story submission. Students can send in their stories and experiences about finance in school and see them published for other students to read.

			On this blog, a student can find some hot shopping deals that help him/her save money.

			There are lots of other resources for students on the Save The Student blog. There’s a student loan repayment calculator to help students keep track of their student loan debt. </p>
